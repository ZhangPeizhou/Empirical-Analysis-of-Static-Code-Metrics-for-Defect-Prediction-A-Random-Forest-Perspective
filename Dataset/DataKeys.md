loc: Total lines of code.
vg (Cyclomatic Complexity): Measures the complexity of the control flow.
evg (Essential Complexity): Indicates the complexity of structured control flow.
ivg (Design Complexity): Reflects the unstructured parts of the control flow.
n: Total number of operators and operands.
v (Volume): A measure from Halstead metrics that represents the size of the code.
l (Program Length): Total number of operations and operands (length of the code).
d (Difficulty): A Halstead metric that represents how difficult the code is to understand or modify.
i (Intelligence Content): Another Halstead metric that estimates the intelligence required to write or understand the software.
e (Effort): Measures the effort required to develop or maintain the code (Halstead metric).
t (Time): Time estimate based on effort (Halstead metric).
lOCode: Lines of code excluding comments and blank lines.
lOComment: Lines of comments in the code.
lOBlank: Lines of blank spaces in the code.
lOCodeAndComment: Combined count of lines of code and comments.
uniq_Op: Total number of unique operators.
uniq_Opnd: Total number of unique operands.
total_Op: Total number of operators.
total_Opnd: Total number of operands.
branchCount: Number of branches in the control flow (e.g., loops, conditionals).
b (Effort): Represents the effort estimation (derived from Halstead's metrics).
defects: Indicates the presence of defects (True/False), which is the target variable for defect prediction.
