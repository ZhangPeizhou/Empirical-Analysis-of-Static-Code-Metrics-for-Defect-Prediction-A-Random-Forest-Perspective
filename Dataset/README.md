# Is-Deep-learning-good-enough-for-software-defect-prediction
This project is a study on bottleneck based models and squeezenet architecture; applying them in the domain of software domain prediction. We employed seven
different open-source datasets from NASA Repository to perform this comparative study. We use F-Measure as a performance evaluator and found these methods statistically outperform eight
state-of-the-art methods with mean F-Measure of 0.93±0.014, and 0.90±0.013, respectively. We found that these two methods are significantly more effective in terms of F-Measure over large
and moderate size projects. But they are computationally expensive in terms of training time. The pre=print for the same paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4089137).
